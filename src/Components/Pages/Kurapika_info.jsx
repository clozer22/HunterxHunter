                  Kurapika is a cool and intelligent individual, possessing vast
                  knowledge. He is reticent; not one to open up to people easily
                  and quite judgmental. His distance from others initially keeps
                  him level-headed and moralistic, but his heart has been
                  poisoned with sadness and hatred. Having been traumatized from
                  losing everyone he loved at the age of twelve, Kurapika closes
                  his heart to new people and remains introverted as to stay
                  focused on his goal. However, Kurapika can be kind and
                  affectionate, smiling when those friends are happy. Though
                  Kurapika outwardly states that he desires to become a
                  Blacklist Hunter and his ultimate goal is to capture the band
                  of thieves that massacred his family, he is willing to
                  compromise his personal morality and delve into the squalid
                  side of society in order to achieve his goal. He is prone to
                  fits of uncontrollable anger should the memory of his clan be
                  insulted in any way.<br /> <br /> After becoming a professional Hunter,
                  Kurapika starts upon a self-destructive path. His anger leads
                  him to commit villainous acts of wrath as catharsis for his
                  pain. Kurapika's reserved demeanor makes him very ruthless and
                  unreasonable at times, but his friends are the only ones able
                  to slightly settle his seething enough for him to think
                  rationally. He slowly transitioned from considering his
                  friendships to be a weakness hindering him from succeeding in
                  his aims to appreciating their value, and he was willing to
                  put his revenge on the Phantom Troupe on hold for his friends'
                  well-being. He even questioned the legitimacy of his quest
                  after experiencing the deep ties that bind the Spiders
                  together, particularly Pakunoda's loyalty, although it
                  ultimately did not deter him.<br /> <br /> Although he made himself
                  unavailable for a period, the people dear to him became part
                  of his drives, leading him to search for more power in order
                  not to lose anyone else. Upon nearly completing his goal of
                  retrieving the eyes of his brethren, he began to feel a deep
                  sense of loss, believing to have no one and nowhere to return
                  to. <br /> <br /> As a child, his personality was more akin to Gon's where
                  he sought out adventure and had an impulsive nature. Kurapika
                  was still protective of his friends, however, going as far as
                  to beat a man for his derogatory comments against one.
