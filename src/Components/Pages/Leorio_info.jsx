                  Leorio is initially introduced as a very selfish narcissist
                  who places great emphasis on material wealth. Despite his
                  assertions that he is only after money, he eventually reveals
                  to Kurapika that his dream is to one day become a doctor in
                  order to help the poor. He believes that all things in the
                  world (lives, dreams, etc.) can be bought and that becoming a
                  Hunter will provide him with the necessary funds for his
                  medical education. Due to his first spat with Kurapika, as
                  well as the test on the way to the navigator's cabin, it seems
                  that he has a sensitivity for those who do not take him
                  seriously or treat him with disrespect. His real priorities
                  seem to be friends first, then his dream of becoming a great
                  doctor, with everything else afterward.
                  <br /> <br />
                  Leorio is not one to balk and retreat when faced with
                  overwhelming odds in battle. A loyal, trustworthy ally who
                  greatly values the ties of friendship, he acts like the 'big
                  brother' of the group. He often provides comic relief; Killua
                  sometimes ridicules him for his comparatively older age,
                  although he swears that his appearance is that of a mere
                  teenager. His impulsive and brash nature has sometimes caused
                  more trouble for the people around him. Another flair he has
                  is his ability to 'straight-talk' through many situations at
                  hand. It could be seen that his closest relationship in the
                  group is with Kurapika because they have spent the most time
                  with each other.
                  <br /> <br /> Although he made himself unavailable for a

                  Melody claims that he has "the nicest heartbeat in the city",
                  stating that "it's warm and gentle" and that he would make for
                  a better doctor than a Hunter.
